# Lumidex v2: Dashboard vs Profile Page Architecture

## Problem with Current Approach
The dashboard became too dense and overwhelming with 8+ widgets. Many components are better suited for a personal profile page where users can dive deep into their collection details.

## Information Architecture Redesign

### 🏠 DASHBOARD (Public-facing, Overview Focus)
**Purpose**: Clean landing page with key actions and market insights
**Target Users**: All visitors (authenticated and guests)
**Layout**: 3-4 focused sections maximum

#### Dashboard Components:
1. **Enhanced Hero Section** ✅ Keep
   - Welcome message (personalized if logged in)
   - 3 primary quick actions
   - Clean, focused call-to-action

2. **Key Metrics Bar** ✅ Keep (Simplified)
   - Collection value
   - Total cards  
   - Quick weekly progress
   - *(Remove detailed charts, keep simple)*

3. **Market Insights** ✅ Keep
   - Price trends affecting all users
   - Market alerts and notifications
   - General market overview
   - *(Universal value, not personal)*

4. **Quick Actions Panel** ✅ Keep (Condensed)
   - 6 most common actions
   - Clean 2x3 grid
   - Essential shortcuts only

5. **Enhanced CTA Section** ✅ Keep
   - Social proof and community stats
   - Next steps for user engagement
   - Links to explore deeper functionality

### 👤 PROFILE PAGE (Personal, Detail Focus)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive personal collection management
**Target Users**: Authenticated users only
**Layout**: Detailed dashboard with personal analytics

#### Profile Page Sections:

##### Header
```
