# Card Completion Visual Indicators - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The card completion visual indicators have been successfully implemented for set pages with support for both Normal and Master set modes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Visual Indicators
- **Greyed Out Effect**: Completed cards show reduced opacity (0.6) and grayscale filter (0.3)
- **Completion Badge**: Green badge with "✓" text appears in top-right corner of completed cards
- **Hover Effects**: Completed cards become less greyed out on hover for better interaction

### 2. Mode-Specific Logic
- **Normal Set Mode**: Card marked completed when any variant is collected (`hasAnyVariant`)
- **Master Set Mode**: Card marked completed when all variants are collected (`hasAllVariants`)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Completion status automatically updates when toggling between modes

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Components Modified
- `CardTileWithCollectionButtons.tsx`: Added completion status props and visual indicators
- `SetCardsWithFilters.tsx`: Added completion status calculation and passing to cards
- `globals.css`: Added CSS styles for completion effects

#### Key Interfaces
```typescript
interface CardCompletionStatus {
  isCompleted: boolean;
  isMasterSetMode: boolean;
  hasAnyVariant: boolean;
  hasAllVariants: boolean;
}
```

#### CSS Classes Added
- `.card-completed`: Greying out effect
- `.completion-badge`: Badge styling and positioning
- `.completion-badge.visible`: Animation for badge appearance

### 4. Accessibility & Responsive Design
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper semantic markup with `aria-label` and `role="status"`
- **Responsive**: Badge scales down on mobile devices
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- **Dark Mode**: Proper contrast and styling for dark mode

### 5. Integration Points
- Uses existing `useSetCollection` hook for collection status
- Leverages existing `cardStatuses` array from collection logic
- Integrates with `MasterSetToggle` component
- Works with existing variant quantity system

## How It Works

1. **Data Flow**: 
   - `SetCardsWithFilters` gets collection status from `useSetCollection`
   - Calculates completion status using `getCardCompletionStatus()`
   - Passes status to each `CardTileWithCollectionButtons`

2. **Visual Updates**:
   - Cards automatically show/hide completion indicators
   - Toggle between Normal/Master modes updates all cards
   - Collection changes trigger visual updates

3. **User Experience**:
   - Clear visual feedback for completed cards
   - Distinguishes between Normal and Master set completion
   - Maintains card interactivity with hover effects

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/globals.css**
   - Added completion badge styles
   - Added greyed out card styles
   - Added responsive and accessibility support

2. **src/components/cards/CardTileWithCollectionButtons.tsx**
   - Added `CardCompletionStatus` interface
   - Added completion status prop
   - Implemented completion badge and greying out

3. **src/components/sets/SetCardsWithFilters.tsx**
   - Added completion status calculation
   - Integrated with existing collection logic
   - Passed status to card components

## Testing Recommendations

When testing the implementation:

1. **Normal Set Mode**:
   - Add any variant to a card → Card should show completion badge and grey out
   - Remove all variants → Card should return to normal appearance

2. **Master Set Mode**:
   - Add some variants (not all) → Card should remain normal
   - Add all available variants → Card should show completion and grey out

3. **Mode Toggle**:
   - Switch between Normal/Master modes → Completion status should update accordingly
   - Cards may change from completed to incomplete or vice versa

4. **Visual Verification**:
   - Completion badge appears in top-right corner
   - Cards become greyed out when completed
   - Hover effects work correctly
   - Responsive design on mobile
